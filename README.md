# 🌿 Sustainify

A better environment is our goals, user experience are our priorities.

## 👾 Tech Stack
<ul>
  <li>Frontend supported by Vue.js & Vite</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>Detailed Analytics</li>
  <li>IoT supported</li>
</ul>

## ✨ How it works
<ol>
  <li>Gather the nearest IoT trash-bin</li>
  <li>Suggesting the user the location of nearest IoT trash-bin</li>
  <li>Upon throwing away trash in the designated trash-bin, user may:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Scan the QR code generated by the trash-bin</li>
    <li>Tap in the NFC spot of the trash-bin</li>
  </ul>
  <li>By doing either of the provided option, user may gain points</li>
  <li>Each point can be redeemed into available coupon or be donated as charity</li>
  <li>Whenever an IoT integrated trash-bin is filled, it will notify the server</li>
  <li>The server will generate a route for the nearest garbage station</li>
  <li>This may leads to easier access and faster garbage pickup</li>
</ol>
